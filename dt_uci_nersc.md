# Data Transfer Overview

RCIC provides a number of tools for UCI users to be able to move their data in and out of UCI.  For data transfer consultation
please contact Joulien Tatar (jtatar@uci.edu).

The Data Transfer Nodes (DTN) are dedicated UCI servers that are optimized for fast data transfers.  These DTNs are on UCI's dedicated 10Gb Lightpath network and part of the Pacific Research Platform (PRP).  The PRP is an initiative to connect research institutions (mostly) on the west coast to the nationwide Science DMZ network.

Installing and Configuring Nextcloud on CentOS 7

Introduction

Nextcloud is a file sharing server that permits you to store your personal content, like documents and pictures, in a centralized location, much like Dropbox. The difference with Nextcloud is that it is free and open-source, which allows anyone to use and examine it. It also returns the control and security of your sensitive data back to you, thus eliminating the utilization of a third-party cloud hosting service.

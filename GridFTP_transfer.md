# GridFTP Data Transfer

GridFTP is an iteration of the FTP protocol, optimized for high-bandwidth grid computing environments.  GridFTP allows users to perform parallel transfers.  It is command line based, but there is also an online client called Globus that provides easy to use point and click interface that adds reliability and automatically optimizes transfers for performance.  It is highly recommended users use Globus over the command line based GridFTP.

# Transferring Data To and From the UCI DTN Using GridFTP clients

GridFTP is available on the UCI FIONA DTN: fiona.oit.uci.edu

## Using globus-url-copy
The basic GridFTP client, distributed with the Globus Toolkit, is called **globus-url-copy**.  It is command line based and it is not interactive.  It allows only one file transfer at a time.

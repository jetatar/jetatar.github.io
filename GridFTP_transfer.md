# GridFTP Data Transfer

GridFTP is an iteration of the FTP protocol, optimized for high-bandwidth grid computing environments.  GridFTP allows users to perform parallel tranfers.  It is command line based, but there is also an online client called Globus that provides easy to use point and click interface that adds reliability and automatically optimizes transfers for performance.  It is highly recommended users use Globus over the command line based GridFTP.
